# Rebrickable Lego

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4.
A partial styling was done using Angular Material.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Running unit tests

Please note that the unit tests are incomplete and some of the tests will fail due to that. I might add them later, when I have time.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
